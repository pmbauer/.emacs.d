;;; slamhound.el --- Rip Clojure namespaces apart and rebuild them.

;; Version: 1.0.0
;; Keywords: tools, lisp

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Destroys the ns form of a clojure-mode buffer and attempts to
;; rebuild it by searching the classpath. Requires an active slime
;; connection.

;; M-x slamhound operates on the current buffer

;; M-x slamhound-project operates on the current source tree

;; If the namespace cannot be reconstructed for whatever reason, the
;; file will remain untouched and the reason will be shown.
